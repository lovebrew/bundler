# Bundler 1.1.0 🎉

## Changes

- Redesigned the footer to be simpler, linking to the Wiki.
- Bundles now use `bundle.toml` instead of `lovebrew.toml`.
- Renamed `packaged` to `package` in Configuration files.
- Renamed the table `icons` to `icon`:
  - Icons no longer need to be specified on a per-console basis.
  - They are resized and reformatted on-demand by the backend.
    - Ideally use a 1024x1024 high-resolution image
